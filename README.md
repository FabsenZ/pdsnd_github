### Analysis of bikeshare data


### Description

The programme analyzes the bikeshare data from three different cities:

* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington

You can narrow down the cities and the time horizon if requested. On that basis it displays statistics along the dimensions of:

* Time_stats
* Station_stats
* Trip_duration_stats
* User_stats

A build-in loop at the end will ask you, if you want to display raw data at the end for closer look.


### Files used

* bikeshare.py
* .gitignore
